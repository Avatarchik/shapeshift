Collider inside shape.
Collider outside shape.
If all insides touching an inside and no outsides touching an inside then the shape fits.

Grid cell length equal to quarter of unit triangle's width.
All silhouettes overlapped:  True.
For each point in overlap grid:
	If silhouette colliders overlap point:
		If a piece collider does not overlap that point:
			Return all silhouettes are not overlapped.
	Else:
		If a piece collider does overlap that point:
			Return all silhouettes are not overlapped.

This depends on collider polygons being more precise than the snapping grid and silhouette oversizing.

Would also want to only enable drag and drop of pieces layer.
